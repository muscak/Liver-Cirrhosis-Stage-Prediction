## Problem Definition

> Cirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption.

In this study we'll tyr to predict the stage of the cirrhosis for a person with the given parameters. Since the number of outcomes are limited, we'll approach this problem as a multi-class classification problem. We'll select and train a machine learning algorithm based on the performance metric which will be deciden in the upcoming section.
